# Neon Bootcamp - Tutorial 4

This is the submission for the fourth installment in Neon's Bootcamp as originally described [here](https://bootcamp.neonevm.org/videos/spl-token-program-library-how-to-use-it-why).

The objective of this tutorial is to create and interact with an SPL token on Solana using Solidity.
* Initialize a new SPL token mint from a Solidity contract
* Create associated token accounts (ATAs)
* Mint, transfer, and burn tokens
* Understand how ATAs differ from arbitrary token accounts
* Use getter functions to read SPL token data

In this tutorial, we aim to do the first of these items, specifically:
* Create an SPL token mint with a new seed and mint tokens from the new mint to an associated token account.

Similar to previous tutorials, we break this down into the following steps:

1. Setting up your local environment (installing required nodejs)
2. Cloning neon-tutorials repo
3. Modifying the deployment script

## Clone repository

Run the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:eastmaels/nbc.git
cd nbc/tutorial4
```

**NOTE** From hereon, the succeeding commands needs to be run from the **nbc/tutorial4** directory.

## Install the required dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Setup Neon network in the Metamask wallet

1. Go to [[Neonpass](https://devnet.neonpass.live/)](https://devnet.neonpass.live/) .
2. Connect your EVM wallet and Solana wallets
3. Send SOL to your EVM wallet 

If you need test tokens:
* SOL: https://faucet.solana.com/
* NEON: https://neonfaucet.org/

## Set up .env file

Create a .env file in the root project folder and add these lines -

Although, I believe it won't be really necessary to create all of these many accounts since they won't be used in our program, I just completed all anyways.

```sh
PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER=<OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_USER_1=<1ST_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_USER_2=<2ND_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_USER_3=<3RD_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_SOLANA=<SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_SOLANA_2=<2ND_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_SOLANA_3=<3RD_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_SOLANA_4=<4TH_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## Run the Deploy script

`npx hardhat test test/composability/spl-token-week4.test.js --network neondevnet`
